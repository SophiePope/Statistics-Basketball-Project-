- Each graph shows every shot taken and where on a basketball court in a single Timberwolves season
- Blue shots mean they were successful
- Green shots mean the person missed

The data included x and Y coordinators of each shot where the last number was a decimal place for example if the Y location was 273 and the X location -245 the ball would have been shot 27.3 feet from the baseline closest to the basket shooting at and 24.5 feet to the left (because of the negative) of the basket. After deciphering what these X and Y coordinates mean, I was able to insert an image of a basketball court underneath the data points to visualize where each shot was taken from. I added blue coloring to shots that were made and green for shots that were missed. I looked specifically at the years 2015 to 2020 and calculated data from the percentage of shots made in each zone by year, but by swapping the years specified in the for loop we can easily look at other years. I also created a code to create data sets that include the percentage of shots made out of attempted in each zone. From these data sets, I found the percentage of shots made above the three-point line from 2015 to 2020 respectively are 32.5, 32.7, 33.7, 34.7, 34.2, and 33.8 percent. I found the percentage of shots made in the backcourt from 2015 to 2020 respectively are 0,0,0,0,0,9.09 percent. From this, we can conclude shots taken in the backcourt are not very successful compared to other shots. The percentage of shots made in the paint (Non-Ra) from 2015 to 2020 respectively to be 37.7, 42.5, 43.7, 44.8, 39.3, 35.1 percent. The percentage of shots made in the left corner for three points from 2015 to 2020 respectively are 36.0, 38.3, 38.5, 38.4, 38.9 percent. The percentage of shots made in the right corner for three points from 2015 to 2020 respectively are 37.1, 38.2, 39.2, 41.8, 37.7, and 33.2 percent. From this, there is a similarity in the percentage of shots made in the right and left corners. I also found the percentage of shots made in mid-range from 2015 to 2020 respectively 37.4, 38.5, 40.0, 40.3, 39.7, and 38.2 percent. The percentage of shots made in the restricted area from 2015 to 2020 respectively are 59.8, 63.7, 65.9, 62.9, and 62.2 percent. The restricted area had the highest percentage of shots made every year.

This plot shows the percentage of shots made out of attempted as a season progresses. The red dots are games lost, and the blue dots are games won. The blue line through the graph is the line of best fit. Looking at this line and comparing them between years, we can see general trends in shot percentage as seasons progress.
